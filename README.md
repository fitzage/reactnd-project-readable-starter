# Readable App

This repository includes backend API code for the readable app, as well as frontend react code.

To get started with the app:

* Clone repo
    - `git clone https://github.com/fitzage/reactnd-project-readable-starter.git readable`
* Install and start the API server
    - `cd [path to clone folder]/readable/api-server`
    - `npm install`
    - `node server`
* In another terminal window, install and start the frontend server
    - `cd [path to clone folder]/readable/frontend`
    - `npm install`
    - `npm start`
* After starting the server, http://localhost:3000 should automatically load in your browser.
* To stop the servers, hit `ctrl-c` in each terminal window
* To pull latest changes
    - `cd [path to clone folder]/readable`
    - `git pull origin master`
* After pulling latest changes, run the above steps again minus the `git clone` command.
* If servers are stopped and you want to run them without pulling any changes
    - `cd [path to clone folder]/readable/api-server`
    - `node server`
    - [new terminal windo] `cd [path to clone folder]/readable/frontend`
    - `npm start`
